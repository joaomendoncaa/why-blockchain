# Why Blockchains?

This repository serves as documentation to justify the existence of blockchain technology. You can contribute to it adding or modifying any of the documents hosted in this repository. The final goal is to keep growing it as a source of truth for all things blockchain related. I envisoned it as a place where you can find the most amount of organized and (marketing) filtered information about the state of the art on blockchains. For now there's no structure to follow but I have some blurry ideas on making technical and opinionated documentation organized by blockchain and so on, and making a client to provide this information.. to be continued..

# Use cases for blockchain technology

## Monetary transactions (global and/or national)

It's not hard to imagine a reality where blockchains are used as the underlying technology to make a lot of international/national monetary systems. They fundamentally solve all the security and reliability issues with such transactional systems, while providing a much more robust platform to sustain demand for human transactions. Blockchains (at the time of writting 2022) are yet to be practical way of interfacing with payments but I'm sure that soon we'll start seeing applications of such architecture and tech on the globe.
